[*Surgical and Assistive Robotics Lab IIIT-Bangalore*](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/sarl/sarl.html)
* Design and development of a Tactile Educational Device for students with visual impairment.
* This novel device provides an effective and efficient method for the self-study of Tactile Diagrams.
* The device consists of a touch sensitive panel and an audio guidance system which provides audio information based on user touch on the Tactile Diagram. The panel was designed as an array of capacitive sensors, integrated with the audio delivery system to provide audio feedback on Tactile response.
* An identification system was designed using RFID, to identify diagrams placed on the panel. This identification was used to initialise information relevant to the diagram.
* The system can thus be used to study multiple diagrams of the users choice. This design was aimed to provide a complete reading solution for graphics based information.
* A manuscript of the design, and a live demonstration of the device were presented at IEEE Sensors 2019, Montreal, Canada.


#### Malaria Parasite Detection
*Machine Learning Course - 5th Semester*
* Detection of malaria infected cells in thin-blood smear images.
* Traditional image processing techniques which were applied in the first stage of the project include -
  1. Blob Detection
  2. Contour Detection
  3. Bag of Visual Words model
* These methods were applied to extract relevant features, which were then used to train the classifier.
* The second stage involved using a Convolution Neural Network to achieve better performance.
