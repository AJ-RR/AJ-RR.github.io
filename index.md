## Projects

#### **Surgical Tool Characterization and Surgeon Skill Assessment from Neurosurgical Videos**

[*Surgical and Assistive Robotics Lab IIIT-Bangalore*](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/sarl/sarl.html)

* Training and evaluation of object detection networks for surgical tool detection, followed by bounding box matching and interpolation to improve frame-wise tool detection in videos. A surgical procedure is characterized by tool on-off time, usage time, and tool trajectory.
* A Neurosurgical video dataset for the project was collected in collaboration with NIMHANS, Bengaluru.


#### **Tactile Audio Gallery**

[*Surgical and Assistive Robotics Lab IIIT-Bangalore*](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/sarl/sarl.html)
* Design and development of a Tactile Educational Device for students with visual impairment.
* This novel device provides an efficient method for the self-study of Tactile Diagrams.
* The device consists of a touch sensitive panel and an audio guidance system which provides audio information based on user touch on the Tactile Diagram. The panel was designed as an array of capacitive sensors, integrated with the audio delivery system to provide audio feedback on Tactile response.
* An identification system was designed using RFID, to identify diagrams placed on the panel. This identification was used to initialise information relevant to the diagram.
* The system can thus be used to study multiple diagrams of the users choice. This design was aimed to provide a complete reading solution for graphics based information.
* A manuscript of the design, and a live demonstration of the device were presented at IEEE Sensors 2019, Montreal, Canada.


#### **Malaria Parasite Detection**
*Machine Learning Course -*[ Prof. G Srinivasaraghavan](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=gsrinivasaraghavan)
* Detection of malaria infected cells in thin-blood smear images.
* Traditional image processing techniques which were applied in the first stage of the project include -
  1. Blob Detection
  2. Contour Detection
  3. Bag of Visual Words model
* These methods were applied to extract relevant features, which were then used to train the classifier.
* The second stage involved using a Convolution Neural Network to achieve better performance.

#### **Dress Recognition and Detection**
* Developed a dress detection system to detect the different kinds of dress that people wear. Initially approached as a two-stage problem: Detect a person in an image using a pre-trained person detector and classify their dress using a ResNet-50 network trained on a dress image dataset.
* Training and evaluation of the YOLOv3 object detection network for detecting the dress worn by a person (T-Shirt, Jacket, Top, Shorts, and Skirt) and a comparison of recognition and detection approaches.
