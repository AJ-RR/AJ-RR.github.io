### Projects

#### **Tactile Audio Gallery**

[*Surgical and Assistive Robotics Lab IIIT-Bangalore*](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/sarl/sarl.html)
* Design and development of a Tactile Educational Device for students with visual impairment.
* This novel device provides an effective and efficient method for the self-study of Tactile Diagrams.
* The device consists of a touch sensitive panel and an audio guidance system which provides audio information based on user touch on the Tactile Diagram. The panel was designed as an array of capacitive sensors, integrated with the audio delivery system to provide audio feedback on Tactile response.
* An identification system was designed using RFID, to identify diagrams placed on the panel. This identification was used to initialise information relevant to the diagram.
* The system can thus be used to study multiple diagrams of the users choice. This design was aimed to provide a complete reading solution for graphics based information.
* A manuscript of the design, and a live demonstration of the device were presented at IEEE Sensors 2019, Montreal, Canada.


#### **Malaria Parasite Detection**
[*Machine Learning Course - Prof. G Srinivasaraghavan*](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=gsrinivasaraghavan)
* Detection of malaria infected cells in thin-blood smear images.
* Traditional image processing techniques which were applied in the first stage of the project include -
  1. Blob Detection
  2. Contour Detection
  3. Bag of Visual Words model
* These methods were applied to extract relevant features, which were then used to train the classifier.
* The second stage involved using a Convolution Neural Network to achieve better performance.

#### **FM anti-jamming transmitter-receiver in MATLAB**
[*Principles of Communication Systems Course - Prof. Jyotsna Bapat*](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=jyotsnabapat)
* Analysis of the capture effect in FM receivers and potential jamming techniques.
* Design of a FM transmitter and receiver with Frequency hopping scheme for jamming avoidance.
* Analysis of the effect of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) introduced by the channel, followed by implementation of various noise reduction techniques.
* Study and application of Wiener Filters for noise reduction.

#### **Physical Activity Classification Using Smartphone based Motion sensors**
[*Digital Signal Processing Course - Prof. Dinesh Babu*](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=dineshbabujayagopi)
* Classification model to classify four activities - Walking, Running, Jumping and Climbing.
* The data was collected using the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors of a smartphone.
* Training of the classification model on features extracted from the sensors' data.

#### **Speech Dialect Classification**
[*Digital Signal processing Course - Prof. Dinesh Babu*](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=dineshbabujayagopi)
* Classification of nine different dialects in the British English Language.
* The speech corpus IViE(Intonational Variation in English) dataset was used.
* Extraction of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features and their aggregation at the audio level, to train the classification model.

#### **Remote Loading and Execution of a Program - 8051 microcontroller**
[*Microprocessors and Microcontrollers Course - Prof. K K Subramaniam*](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=kksubramaniam)
* Transmission, reception and execution of a program.
* Encoding of a program into Intel Hex (ihex) format and transmission via UART Serial Communication.
* Decoding of the program, followed by execution at the receiver.

#### **Design of a Direct Mapped Cache in Verilog**
[*Computer Architecture Course - Prof. Nanditha Rao*](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=drnanditharao)
* Design of a Direct Mapped Cache in Verilog with LRU scheme for replacement.
* Analysis of hit rates for varying block sizes and cache levels.

#### **Traffic Light Controller in Verilog**
[*Digital Design Course - Prof. Subajit Sen*](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=subajitsen)
* Design of a 4-State traffic light controller in Verilog
* Random traffic was simulated by a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)

#### **Airhockey game in python**
[*Programming Course - Prof. Sujit Kumar Chakrabarti*](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=sujitkumarchakrabarti)
* Developed a simple 2 player Air Hockey game in python, using the pygame library.
