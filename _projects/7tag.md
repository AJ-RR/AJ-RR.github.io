<ul>
<li>Developed a low-cost tactile-audio device to assist in self-study of tactile diagrams for visually impaired students.</li>
<li>Designed a capacitive sensor array integrated its response with an audio content delivery system.</li>
<li>Programmed the Arduino microcontroller to receive sensor data via IÂ²C protocol and integrated a real-time RFID
identification system for tactile diagrams. The work was presented and demonstrated at IEEE Sensors 2019. Visit my publications section to view the paper.</li>
<li> A demonstration of the working on the device can be found in <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHtBffsXNwQ&t=1s">here</a>.</li>
