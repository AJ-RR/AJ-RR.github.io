<ul>
<li>This project was undertaken in a team of four. We examined the ethical and philosophical implications of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and proposed simple design considerations that can mitigate these implications.</li>
<li>My contribution was the analysis of moral responsibility for BCI mediated actions and how modifications in BCI design could aid in solving the problem of attributing moral responsibility among BCI users.</li>
