<ul>
<li>Detection of surgical tools in videos of neurosurgical procedures using CNN-based object detection networks.
Four commonly used tools were considered: Suction, Cusa, Bipolar and Dissection Forceps.</li>
<li>Improved the frame-wise tool detection performance in videos using bounding-box matching and interpolation
techniques to identify undetected tools in intermeditate frames and also correct false detections.</li>
<li>Characterized the tools based on their on-off time/frequency, total usage time and motion trajectory in the
surgical procedure. These characterizations are an important indicator of surgical skill.</li>
<li>A technical paper of the project has been submitted to IEEE EMBC 2021.</li>
