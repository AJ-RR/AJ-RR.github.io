<ul>
<li>Machine learning model to classify four activities - Walking, Running, Jumping and Climbing.</li>
<li>The dataset was collected using the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors of a smartphone.</li>
<li>Features such as mean, variance, standard deviation, etc, were extracted from the motion signals in a windowed fashion</li>
