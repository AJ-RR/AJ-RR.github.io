<ul>
<li>Studyed the potential (anti)jamming techniques for FM transceivers.</li>
<li>Designed a FM transmitter and receiver with Frequency hopping scheme for jamming avoidance.</li>
<li>Studied the effect of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) introduced by the channel and applied a weiner filter for noise reduction.</li>
