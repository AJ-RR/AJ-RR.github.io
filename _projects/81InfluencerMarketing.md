<ul>
<li>Built an agent-based model (ABM) that can simulate the dynamics of influencer advertizing campaigns in a variety of scenarios and can help to discover the best influencer marketing strategy.</li>
<li>Designed a probabilistic graph-based model that incorporates real-world factors such as customers' interest in a product, customer behavior, the willingness to pay, a brand's investment cap, influencers' engagement with influence diffusion, and the nature of the product being advertized.</li>
<li>Our simulations reveal the importance of different influencers (e.g. micro-influencers and celebrities) in varying circumstances of advertizing.</li>
