<ul>
<li>Detection and characterization of neurosurgical tools in videos for the estimation of surgical skills.</li>
<li>Four commonly used tools are considered: Suction, Cusa, Bipolar and Dissection Forceps.</li>
<li>Tools are classified and localized using an object detection network</li>
<li>The detections are used to compute parameters that indicate surgicail skills - Tool on/off time, tool usage time and tool motion trajectory.</li>
<li>Implemented a bounding-box matching and interpolation method to improve frame-wise detection in videos: identify undetected tools in intermeditate frames and also correct false detections.</li>
<li>This work has been accepted for publication at the Conference of the IEEE EMBC 2021.</li>
