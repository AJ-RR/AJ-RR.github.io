<ul>
<li>Built an object detection network to localize four different surgical tools in videos and implemented a bounding box matching and bilinear interpolation algorithm to improve detection performance.</li>
<li>Tool usage of a surgeon was characterized by computing parameters like usage frequency, total usage
time, and motion trajectory.</li>
<li>Comparison with studies where tool usage was analyzed manually revealed that automated methods to analyze surgical skill from tool usage are viable.</li>
<li>This research was in collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, India</li>
<li>This work was presented at the Conference of the IEEE EMBC 2021.</li>
