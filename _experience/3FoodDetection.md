<ul>
<li>Detection and segmentation of Food items from egocentric wearable camera images to aid in automatic food intake monitoring.</li>
<li>Built and ensemble of neural networks based on the YOLO object detection algorithm to localize food items in the camera's scene.</li>
<li>Explored extensive data augmentation to boost performance on the real-world dataset.</li>
<li>Integrated a combination of the K-Means and Normalized-cut algorithms to segment parts of food post detection.</li>
<li>This work was presented at the Conference of the IEEE EMBC 2021.</li>
