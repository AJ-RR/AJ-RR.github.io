<ul>
<li>Detection of Food objects from egocentric wearable camera images using the YOLO object detection networks.</li>
<li>Achieved significant improvement in detection performance by creating an ensemble of networks which are
merged at the NMS step. I also applied various data-preprocessing techniques including blur image rejection,
low light image enhancement and extensive data augmentation to boost performance on the real-world dataset.</li>
<li>Integrated a segmentation pipeline using graph-cut to segment the parts of food on a plate post object detection.</li>
<li>A full conference paper has been submitted.</li>
