<ul>
<li>Built an agent-based model to simulate influencer advertizing campaigns and study advertizing strategies.</li>
<li>Simulations were performed on real-world datasets and our results reveal the importance of different kinds of influencers (e.g. micro-influencers and celebrities) in varying circumstances of advertizing.</li>
<li>For instance, we show that as the nature of the product varies from luxury to non-luxury, the performance of celebrities declines, whereas the performance of nano-influencers improves.</li>
<li>This work has been published in the IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems.</li>
