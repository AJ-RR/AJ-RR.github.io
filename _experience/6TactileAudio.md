<ul>
<li>Developed a tactile-audio device to assist visually impaired students in studying tactile diagrams. The device provides audio feedback based on touch.</li>
<li>The design involves a capacitive sensor array to localize touch, an audio content delivery system, and an RFID identification system. I2C and SPI were used to communicate with sensors and peripherals.</li>
<li>The work was presented and demonstrated at IEEE Sensors 2019. A demonstration of the working of the device can be found <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHtBffsXNwQ&t=1s">here</a></li>
